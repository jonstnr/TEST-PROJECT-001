# Research Report: Best Practices for Scalable Web Applications

## Summary
This report summarizes the best practices for building scalable web applications, including microservices, load balancing, caching, database sharding, asynchronous processing, auto-scaling, monitoring, and use of CDNs.

## Recommendations
- Adopt microservices for modularity and scalability.
- Implement load balancing to distribute traffic.
- Use caching and CDNs to reduce server load and latency.
- Design databases for sharding and replication.
- Monitor system health and set up auto-scaling.
