# Research Report: Chat-like Self File Hosting App

## Summary
This report explores the best tools and design patterns for building a self-hosted file organization app disguised as a chat interface. The app will allow users to create "groups" (topics) and organize files/notes within each group, mimicking the look and feel of WhatsApp.

## Recommendations
- Use React or Next.js for the frontend chat UI.
- Consider Electron for a desktop version with local file access.
- Store files locally using Node.js fs, with SQLite for metadata.
- Implement local authentication and consider optional encryption for privacy.
- Reference open-source chat apps for UI/UX inspiration.
