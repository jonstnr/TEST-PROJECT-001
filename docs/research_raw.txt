Chat-like Self File Hosting App (Raw Research)

- React and Next.js are popular for chat-like UIs (see: react-chat-ui, react-chat-elements)
- Electron can be used for a desktop app with local file access
- File storage options: local filesystem (Node.js fs), SQLite (for metadata), or cloud (optional)
